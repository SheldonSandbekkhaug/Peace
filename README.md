Personal Experiments And Computing Endeavors

Currently creating a 2-D game using LibGDX and Kryonet. 

It is not recommended that anyone run the game yet! Game is still in pre-alpha.

To do pre-alpha testing:

1. Launch the server:
java -jar jars/PeaceGameServer-x.x.jar

2. Launch the client(s)
java -jar jars/Peace-x.x.jar

3. Enter the IP address of the server (default is localhost).
(If the terminal reports an error, check your IP address and restart the client.)

5. You should see the game screen, but are not yet able to do anything.

6. After all players have connected, press S to start. First player to hold three
"centers" for a full turn wins.
